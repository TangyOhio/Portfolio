          I enjoy using React in the front and Ruby on Rails in the back. 
          I'm always trying to learn new things, and I love coding because 
          there is always something more to figure out. I decided to learn SASS,
          and I built this site with it.

          I love computers, and I've been playing with them ever since I was a kid. 
          I enjoy video games, spending time with my family, and giant robot fights.
