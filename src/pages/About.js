        <p> I'm a Full Stack Web Developer. </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I enjoy using React in the frontend, and I've used languages like
          Ruby, Python, and Elixir in the backend.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I love computers, and I've been playing with them ever since I was a
          kid. I enjoy video games and spending time with my family.
