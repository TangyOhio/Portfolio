      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I'm a Junior Web Developer, and I strive to be a Full Stack Developer someday.</p>
      <p>I enjoy using React in the front and Ruby on Rails in the back. I'm learning SASS, which is what I built this site with.</p>
      <p>I've loved everything to do with computers since I was a kid. I enjoy video games, white hat hacking, and giant robot fights.</p>
